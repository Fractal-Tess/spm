### What is this?

This is a simple desktop app that wraps the local ssh client.
The main goal of this app is to provide conveniently functionality for making secure SSH tunnels

### Requirements

By it's nature, this app uses the local ssh client utility and the pub/pri key for authentication.

This means that the user is required to have:

- ssh client
- server with properly configured pub key
- a private key used for authentication
